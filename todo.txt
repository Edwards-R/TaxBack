UPDATE: It hasn't worked. There are 1603 distinct new and 1596 old. There are also multiple tiks that don't show in the translate table.

	Back to the drawing board.

The problem is the synonyms. Current names all check out fine

Did a join using concatenated values, seems to have worked. It found one deleted species that was still present in the records. That was purged.

Backup is made

Clear to make the move

Updated database

Trigger reenabled

Exported to checker

Trimmed the checker's species dictionary down from all the crazy stuff in it. 1/3 size now. Also fixed everything to ignore types and just care about understandings
