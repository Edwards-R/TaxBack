Running SQL tests on merge and update
From a clean clone, merge two taxa and then pick one to run update_children on.
For example, merge superfamilies (rank 2) 6,7 together, then run update children on 6 

CALL cs_update_children(
	2,
	6,
	10,
	'Tester',
	2022
)

This will update all the children

In a lottery-winning chance, I found a glitch in the data.

Lasius psammophilus has two current understandings: 270 and 277. Need to get a good understanding on what and why these exist. They shouldn't.
Fix this, then re-clone, then re-run tests
