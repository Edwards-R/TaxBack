Running SQL tests on merge and update
From a clean clone, merge two taxa and then pick one to run update_children on.
For example, merge superfamilies (rank 2) 6,7 together, then run update children on 6 

CALL cs_merge(
	2,
	ARRAY[6,7],
	'TestTaxon',
	'Tester',
	2022,
	1
);

CALL cs_update_children(
	2,
	6,
	8
)

This will update all the children

In a lottery-winning chance, I found a glitch in the data.

Lasius psammophilus has two current understandings: 270 and 277. Need to get a good understanding on what and why these exist. They shouldn't.
Fix this, then re-clone, then re-run tests


L.psammophilus 277 synonymised to 270

update_children ran without error. Took 121ms, which is WAY faster than I expected.

Seems to have worked perfectly. I'm suspicious, but can't find any problems, other than it including aggregates which was up in the air anyway.

Aggregates need to be removed. They don't exist under the new understanding as aggregates are by definition bound to their creation parent.
Understanding the current meaning of an aggregate understanding is the job of the composition table, so it is safe to retire aggregate understandings
