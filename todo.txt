Clean slate!
So. Now it's species composition that needs to be filled in. There's a few holes in aggregates:

Chrysis ignita agg iso. Paukkunnen et al: 2015
    Does this aggregate also contain C. terminata?
    YES, change this

There's an option to fix a weird thing, but it needs a note in the BWARS newsletter:
-- Merge O. inermis agg iso: Amiet et al and O. parietina agg iso: Amiet et al into O. parietina iso: BWARS: 2022
--     Components are O. inermis iso Amiet et al, O. parietina Amiet et al, O. uncinata Else & Edwards

These two are functionally identical and only one should have been used. The question is 'is it worth the disruption to combine them?' I'm leaning towards no -
it's a fault, but it's a harmless one

SQL command: 

SELECT *
	FROM taxonomy.species
	WHERE id NOT IN (
	SELECT s.id
	FROM taxonomy.species_composition sc
	JOIN taxonomy.species s ON sc.subject = s.id
	WHERE s.name like '%agg')
	AND name like '%agg'
	ORDER BY year DESC

This will find any aggregate that isn't in the composition

T. caespitum agg - this one is a problem. A pre-emptive aggregate, which now shouldn't happen under the new system. Needs a manual fix? Need to suspend the checker
if I'm going to do this. Can't have stuff come in with an ID that no longer exists.
